        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I am an entry-level front-end web developer who gets <em>giddy</em> at the thought of using code to make and change elements on web pages. I have a broad range of professional experience and skills ranging from desktop trouble-shooting to the ability to hand code <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
        <p>I love learning, especially learning about web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've only just started taking the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Front End Career Path at Thinkful</a> and I'm already loving what I've learned!</p>
        <p>I volunteer with a local conservation organization that does river and trail repair as well as offering monthly presenters on related topics. Additionally, I manage their WordPress website as well as creating content for the site.</p>

        <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
        <p>I am from Boulder, CO and am grateful for the wonderful childhood I had wandering through the foothills throwing rocks, breaking sticks and <strong>falling in love with the mountains</strong>. But like a lot of Coloradans, <strong>I also love the ocean</strong>. I went to school on the Gulf Coast for my Communications degree and I have been fortunate enough to spend a lot of time on the West coast.</p>
        <p>I have left the Denver/Boulder area a few times for love and/or money but I always return. There's no place like it and I'm greatful to be back again.</p>

        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
        <p>Besides coding, I love to do all the things that make Colorado so great. I am a fly fisherman and fly tyer (I tie fur and feathers to a hook in an attempt to trick trout into eating the fake bug). I love to mountain bike and hike in the summer and ski in the winter. I'm also a hobbyist photographer. Basically, I have too many hobbies and not enough time or disposable income!</p>
        <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
        <p>I am looking for an entry to junior level front-end web developer opportunity in the Denver area with a company that can benefit from and foster my curiosity and my desire to do good work and with an office environment that <strong>welcomes dogs</strong>.</p>
        <h2>What's your background?</h2>
        <p>I have a broad range of professional experience and skills ranging from desktop trouble-shooting to the ability to hand code HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have worked in a wide variety of industries including outdoor recreation, healthcare, insurance brokerage and Government.</p>
        <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
        <p>I love music and have recently been getting into electronic dance music on the mellow side. But I also like several indie bands like <a href="http://americanmary.com/" target="_blank">The National</a>, <a href="http://www.phantogram.com/" target="_blank">Phantogram</a> and <a href="http://www.tvontheradio.com/" target="_blank">TV On The Radio</a>.</p>
